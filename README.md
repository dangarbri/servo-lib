# Servo Library for Raspberry Pi Pico
I haven't found a complete well documented servo
library. Some do come up which I'm sure might even
be better than this library, but don't have enough
documentation to make them easily usable. This library
intends to be fully documented so you can hack in
any changes you need (please make pull requests!)
and easily include it in your own projects.
